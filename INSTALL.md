## Overview

### Components

#### Main

This repository, although called `toxcore`, in fact contains several libraries besides `toxcore` which complement it, as well as several executables. However, note that although these are separate libraries, at the moment, when building the libraries, they are all merged into a single `toxcore` library. Here is the full list of the main components that can be built using the CMake, their dependencies and descriptions.

| Name             | Type       | Dependencies                                  | Platform       | Description                                                                |

#### Secondary

There are some programs that are not plugged into the CMake build system which you might find interesting. You would need to build those programs yourself. These programs reside in [`other/fun`](other/fun) directory.

## Building

### Requirements

#### Library dependencies

Library dependencies are listed in the [components](#components) table. The dependencies need to be satisfied for the components to be built. Note that if you don't have a dependency for some component, e.g. you don't have `libopus` installed required for building `toxav` component, building of that component is silently disabled.

#### Compiler requirements

The supported compilers are GCC, Clang and MinGW.

In theory, any compiler that fully supports C99 and accepts GCC flags should work.

There is a partial and experimental support of Microsoft Visual C++ compiler. We welcome any patches that help improve it.

You should have a C99 compatible compiler in order to build the main components. The secondary components might require the compiler to support GNU extensions.

#### Build system requirements

To build the main components you need to have CMake of at least 2.8.6 version installed. You also need to have pkg-config installed, the build system uses it to find dependency libraries.

There is some experimental accommodation for building natively on Windows, i.e. without having to use MSYS/Cygwin and pkg-config, but it uses exact hardcoded paths for finding libraries and supports building only of some of toxcore components, so your mileage might vary.

### CMake options

There are some options that are available to configure the build.

You can get this list of option using the following commands

```sh
grep "option(" CMakeLists.txt cmake/*
grep "set(.* CACHE" CMakeLists.txt cmake/*
```

Note that some options might be considered only if other options are enabled.

Example of calling cmake with options

```sh
cmake \
  -D ENABLE_STATIC=OFF \
  -D MIN_LOGGER_LEVEL=DEBUG \
  -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt \
  -D TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=120 \
  ..
```

### Build process

#### Unix-like

Assuming all the [requirements](#requirements) are met, just run

```sh
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

#### Windows

##### Building on Windows host

###### Microsoft Visual Studio's Developer Command Prompt

In addition to meeting the [requirements](#requirements), you need a version of Visual Studio (the [community edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-express/) is enough) and a CMake version that's compatible with the Visual Studio version you're using.

You must also ensure that the msvc versions of dependencies you're using are placed in the correct folders.

For libsodium that is `c-toxcore/third_party/libsodium`, and for pthreads-w32, it's `c-toxcore/third_party/pthreads-win32`

Once all of this is done, from the **Developer Command Prompt for VS**, simply run

```
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake ..
msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
```

###### MSYS/Cygwin

Download Cygwin ([32-bit](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86.exe)/[64-bit](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe))

Search and select exactly these packages in Devel category:

  - mingw64-i686-gcc-core (32-bit) / mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core (64-bit)
  - mingw64-i686-gcc-g++ (32-bit) / mingw64-x86_64-gcc-g++ (64-bit)
  - make
  - cmake
  - libtool
  - autoconf
  - automake
  - tree
  - curl
  - perl
  - yasm
  - pkg-config

To handle Windows EOL correctly run the following in the Cygwin Terminal:

```sh
echo '
export SHELLOPTS
set -o igncr
' > ~/.bash_profile
```

Download toxcore source code and extract it to a folder.

Open Cygwin Terminal in the toxcore folder and run `./other/windows_build_script_toxcore.sh` to start the build process.

Toxcore build result files will appear in `/root/prefix/` relatively to Cygwin folder (default `C:\cygwin64`).

Dependency versions can be customized in `./other/windows_build_script_toxcore.sh` and described in the section below.


##### Cross-compiling from Linux

These cross-compilation instructions were tested on and written for 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04. You could generalize them for any Linux system, the only requirements are that you have Docker version of >= 1.9.0 and you are running 64-bit system.

The cross-compilation is fully automated by a parameterized [Dockerfile](/other/docker/windows/Dockerfile).

Install Docker

```sh
apt-get update
apt-get install docker.io
```

Get the toxcore source code and navigate to `other/docker/windows`.

Build the container image based on the Dockerfile. The following options are available to customize the building of the container image.

| Name                  | Description                                                    | Expected Value                      | Default Value |

## Pre-built binaries

### Linux

Toxcore is packaged by at least by the following distributions: ALT Linux, [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=toxcore), [Fedora](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/toxcore), Mageia, openSUSE, PCLinuxOS, ROSA and Slackware, [according to the information from pkgs.org](https://pkgs.org/download/toxcore). Note that this list might be incomplete and some other distributions might package it too.
