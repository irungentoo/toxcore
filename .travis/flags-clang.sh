# Disable specific warning flags for both C and C++.

# TODO(iphydf): Clean these up. Probably all of these are actual bugs.
add_flag -Wno-cast-align
# Very verbose, not very useful. This warns about things like int -> uint
# conversions that change sign without a cast and narrowing conversions.
add_flag -Wno-conversion
# TODO(iphydf): Check enum values when received from the user, then assume
# correctness and remove this suppression.
add_flag -Wno-covered-switch-default
# Due to clang's tolower() macro being recursive
# https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore/pull/481
add_flag -Wno-disabled-macro-expansion
# We don't put __attribute__ on the public API.
add_flag -Wno-documentation-deprecated-sync
# Bootstrap daemon does this.
add_flag -Wno-format-nonliteral
# struct Foo foo = {0}; is a common idiom.
add_flag -Wno-missing-field-initializers
# Useful sometimes, but we accept padding in structs for clarity.
# Reordering fields to avoid padding will reduce readability.
add_flag -Wno-padded
# This warns on things like _XOPEN_SOURCE, which we currently need (we
# probably won't need these in the future).
add_flag -Wno-reserved-id-macro
# TODO(iphydf): Clean these up. They are likely not bugs, but still
# potential issues and probably confusing.
add_flag -Wno-sign-compare
# Our use of mutexes results in a false positive, see 1bbe446.
add_flag -Wno-thread-safety-analysis
# File transfer code has this.
add_flag -Wno-type-limits
# Callbacks often don't use all their parameters.
add_flag -Wno-unused-parameter
# libvpx uses __attribute__((unused)) for "potentially unused" static
# functions to avoid unused static function warnings.
add_flag -Wno-used-but-marked-unused
# We use variable length arrays a lot.
add_flag -Wno-vla

# Disable specific warning flags for C++.

# Comma at end of enum is supported everywhere we run.
