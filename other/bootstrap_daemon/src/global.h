// The version is in a visual decimal format rather than in any other format,
// because the original version was using a similar format, it was using
// YYYYMMDDVV date-based format for the version, with VV being an incremental
// counter in case more than one version was released at that day. Due to this
// some tools started showing the version to users as a plain number, rather
// than some binary format that needs to be parsed before being shown to users
// so we decided to keep this display format compatibility and adopted this
// weird scheme with a leading 1.
