/**
 * The timer portion of the toxcore event loop.
 *
 * We update the time exactly once per tox_iterate call. Programs built on lower
 * level APIs such as the DHT bootstrap node must update the time manually in
 * each iteration.
 *
 * Time is kept per Tox instance, not globally, even though "time" as a concept
 * is global. This is because by definition `mono_time` represents the time at
 * the start of an iteration, and also by definition the time when all network
 * events for the current iteration occurred. This affects mainly two situations:
 *
 * 1. Two timers started in the same iteration: e.g. two timers set to expire in
 *    10 seconds will both expire at the same time, i.e. about 10 seconds later.
 *    If the time were global, `mono_time` would be a random number that is
 *    either the time at the start of an iteration, or 1 second later (since the
 *    timer resolution is 1 second). This can happen when one update happens at
 *    e.g. 10:00:00.995 and a few milliseconds later a concurrently running
 *    instance updates the time at 10:00:01.005, making one timer expire a
 *    second after the other.
 * 2. One timer based on an event: if we want to encode a behaviour of a timer
 *    expiring e.g. 10 seconds after a network event occurred, we simply start a
 *    timer in the event handler. If a concurrent instance updates the time
 *    underneath us, it may instead expire 9 seconds after the event.
 *
 * Both these situations cause incorrect behaviour randomly. In practice,
 * toxcore is somewhat robust against strange timer behaviour, but the
 * implementation should at least theoretically match the specification.
