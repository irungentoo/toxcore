/*******************************************************************************
 *
 * This module is organized into two parts.
 *
 * 1. A simple API operating on plain text/cipher text data and a password to
 *    encrypt or decrypt it.
 * 2. A more advanced API that splits key derivation and encryption into two
 *    separate function calls.
 *
 * The first part is implemented in terms of the second part and simply calls
 * the separate functions in sequence. Since key derivation is very expensive
 * compared to the actual encryption, clients that do a lot of crypto should
 * prefer the advanced API and reuse pass-key objects.
 *
 * To use the second part, first derive an encryption key from a password with
 * tox_pass_key_derive, then use the derived key to encrypt the data.
 *
 * The encrypted data is prepended with a magic number, to aid validity
 * checking (no guarantees are made of course). Any data to be decrypted must
 * start with the magic number.
 *
 * Clients should consider alerting their users that, unlike plain data, if
 * even one bit becomes corrupted, the data will be entirely unrecoverable.
 * Ditto if they forget their password, there is no way to recover the data.
